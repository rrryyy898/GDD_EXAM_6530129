GDD Final Exam – Unity (3-in-1)
This repo contains a Unity project with three games: Mad Driver (DrivingGame), Fly Like a Bird (FlyingGame), and I’m a Sumo and a Ball (SumoGame). Due to GitHub upload limits, **Project** is provided as **Project.zip** — extract it at the project root so the structure is: Assets/, Packages/, ProjectSettings/. Open **MainMenu** (index 0) to play; press **Esc** for the in-game pause menu (Resume/Restart/Back).

**Why Assets.zip?**  
GitHub’s web uploader limits drag-and-drop to ~100 files per upload, and a Unity `Assets/` folder has hundreds/thousands of files. Zipping `Assets/` avoids that limit, keeps the repo clean (no `Library/`, `Temp/`), and ensures a fast, reliable exam submission. 

Due to GitHub’s file limit, I uploaded the Unity project as zip files
